                <h4>How is your enterprise reducing poverty?</h4>
                <p>
                    Poverty is defined as a state or condition in which an individual or a group lacks the financial means and necessities for a basic level of living. Bangladesh is still a developing country. Poverty remains a big concern, notwithstanding rapid economic
                    progress. We're working to address this social issue by building a strong, capable, engaged, and competent community that can contribute to a person's ability to conduct employment that generates economic value. We believe that education
                    is the most effective way to enhance human capital while simultaneously contributing directly to economic prosperity.

                <h2>Our methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    Seminars, group sessions, one-on-one counseling, and family counseling are all used to help students develop goals. We consider the types of talent, talent's inclination, the student's and his or her family's expectations, and other factors. Then we split
                    them up into four or five groups and prepare them for the admissions battle. We provide ongoing mental support and inspiration during that period because mental stress is a game changer in the admissions era. We also provide financial
                    assistance to needy students to the extent that we are able. In our organization, there is a medical student team, an engineering student team, and scientific and arts background students' teams.

                    As Bangladesh enters the demographic dividend period, an increasing number of students are finding their academic lives to be meaningless. Our long-serving counselors come from a variety of academic fields, including medical, engineering, social science,
                    and fine arts, and will provide one-on-one counseling to students, assisting them in shaping their academic and professional futures in the educational sector.

                <p>
                    According to our observations, approximately 80 students are now enrolled in various public universities in Bangladesh. Debating societies, acquiring standard Bangla, English, and Arabic, and preparing students for numerous competitions, Olympiads, and
                    other activities are all part of our skill development program. As a result, our pupils have already won several national competitions. Women and girls ranging from 13 years to 35 years ages were beneficiaries of our actions.

                <p>
                    One of the most crucial of our fundamental human rights is education. However, our educational system is wholly results-driven, rather than inventive. In our society, an increasing number of students are approaching the point where their academic lives
                    are meaningless. There are some concerns with the following topics:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> A lack of interest in studying</li>

                    <li> The Academic and Ethical Conundrum</li>
                    <li> A lack of proper information</li>
                    <li> A lack of concentration</li>
                    <li> A lack of awareness</li>
                    <li> Diminishes the educational value</li>
                    <li> A lack of materials</li>
                    <li> problems of poverty and drop out (especially female students)</li>
                </ol>

            <!-- Solution -->
            <div class="solution">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    We must solve the existing issues with the materials that we already have in our country. We want to introduce a new and effective system for improving the basic skills among the students range from class 9 to undergrad students through one-to-one counselling.
                    The counselors will be the immediate seniors of the students who have already faced these problems from different sectors. And then counselled students will be trained to become professional counselors. Thus, we are creating a chain
                    of connection among students for sustainability.
